                    Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose

                    Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability's presence.
                    Do not use an exploit to compromise or obtain data, establish command line
                    access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to "pivot" to other systems.

                    or trade secrets of any party), you must stop your test, notify us immediately,
                    and keep the data strictly confidential.
